        "abstract": "This project studies why gender gaps in land ownership persist despite equal inheritance laws in Nepal. It examines whether behavioral and social frictions—such as information asymmetries, intra-household fairness norms, and stigma costs—limit the realization of formal legal rights. Using a theory-guided experimental framework, the research aims to assess which constraints most strongly inhibit the translation of legal reform into de facto ownership outcomes.",
